# Pupil Hardware DIY

We release the CAD files for the camera mounts for you to download and modify, in accordance with our license. CAD files for the frame are not open source, but we do document the interface for the DIY kit.

For more information see the Pupil Hardware Development page on the Pupil wiki [here](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/wiki/Pupil-Hardware-Development).
